## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practiced CSS, tried some new selectors and improved the visual hierarchy/order. 

Didn't learn a lot more with this challenge but improved my initial approach and basic CSS knowledge.

### Continued development

Continue to improve my basics. Also want to try less 'choppy' media queries, make the components grow seamingless.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - My go to for HTML and CSS questions.
